# 2008 MaxxCrawford.com Portfolio Website

This was the first iteration of my portfolio website. I created as an assignment during my studies at the University of Arkansas - Fort Smith. This was created using PhotoShop, ImageReady and DreamWeaver. 

And yeah â€“ You'll need Flash to view the portfolio.
